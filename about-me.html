<p>Hello, I am Alex Hou, a Freshman in the department of Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign(UIUC). Now, I imagine you might want to know a little bit more about this random person who you just found on the internet. Well, I am here to help! Alex decided to come to the UIUC after coming to the ICTM state math team competition with the Morton High School math team. After many fond experiences, Alex chose the UIUC's familiar atmoshere. Alex chose to major in Statistics because they desired to keep pursuing mathematics into higher education, but eventually decided on statistics because every encounter they had with statistics was a powerful learning experience.</p>
<p>Upon Alex's arrival at the UIUC they decided to begin trying to pursue a transfer into Stats+CS, and have been moving along at a steady pace. During their first semester they had a chance to experience the CS 498sl course, which introduced them to VR. It was an exhilirating—if painful experience for their GPA—that stoked the flames of their kindled desire to pursue further experience in computer science.</p>
